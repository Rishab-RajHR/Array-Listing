Array.map() is a built-in JavaScript method used to transform array elements.

It creates a new array by applying a function to each item in the original array.

Commonly used to list and display data in UI frameworks like React.

map() does not modify the original array (immutable operation).

Each iteration receives the current item, index, and entire array.

Ideal for rendering lists such as users, products, or menu items.

In React, always provide a unique key when mapping arrays.

Improves code readability and reduces manual loops.

Best suited for pure transformations, not side effects.
